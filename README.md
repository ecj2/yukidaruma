# Yukidaruma

A simple game created by [Eric](https://tins.amarillion.org/krampu20/log/4213/) for [Elias](https://tins.amarillion.org/krampu20/log/4214/) during [KrampusHack 2020](https://tins.amarillion.org/krampu20/rules/).

Elias wished for a game that includes a holiday theme, features lights, and is non-violent. I took several liberties in how I interpreted his wishes, but the result is a game which features basic Christmas themes (a snowman and name-dropping "Christmas"), additive blending for simple lighting, and obstacles contextualized as being hearts comprised of hopes and dreams (non-violent, right?). I hope you enjoy. :)

## Controls

Move left and right with the `left arrow` and `right arrow` keys, and toss snowballs and close prompts with the `z` key.

## How to Install

This game is written in JavaScript and is designed to be played within a Web browser (tested in Chrome 87 and Firefox 84). However, due to security concerns and limitations imposed by [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), loading resources via the `file://` scheme is not permitted. As a result, serving the game from a local Web server is necessary for loading bitmaps and samples. Any old HTTP server should do, but if you run into issues, the game can also be played [on my site](https://thardus.xyz/yukidaruma).
